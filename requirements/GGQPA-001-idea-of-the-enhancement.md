# The enhancement content

We need to enhance the billing engine to support diverse subscription strategies
and variable, model-specific pricing. This requires several changes:

- API enhancement: update the existing POST /api/usage endpoint to accept a new,
  required modelId parameter (e.g. "fast-model", "reasoning-model").
- Model-aware pricing: shift from a single global rate to dynamic pricing, where
  costs vary depending on the specific AI model invoked.
- Multi-plan billing logic: introduce distinct billing behaviors based on the
  customer's subscription tier:
    - Standard plan: retains the global monthly quota, but overage usage is now
      calculated using model-specific rates.
    - Premium plan: operates without a quota limit. Prompt tokens and completion
      tokens are charged separately at different rates depending on the model used.
- Architectural scalability: implement an extensible design pattern, such as
  Strategy or Factory, to isolate calculation formulas for different plans.
